        Elephants Dream is a short film about two people who have different
        visions of the surreal world in which they live. The film is a milestone
        in open source CG animation production. It was the first CG animated
        short made in a team-based environment that was produced almost
        completely with free tools, received a wide distribution around the
        world and made the source files of the production available to the
        public. Created as part of the first Open Movie Project, an idea
        conceived by Ton Rosendaal for improving the capabilities of the open
        source 3D animation software Blender, Elephants Dream presents a highly
        subjective narrative in which staging is used to express the internal
        world of the characters. A stylized, surreal aesthetic mixes futuristic
        and retro elements. The short focuses on the relationship between two
        main characters and their interaction. One of them tries to explain the
        beauties of the world he imagines to the other and conflict surfaces
        when the second character grows skeptical and ends up not accepting the
        ideas. The first one reacts desperately, trying to impose them. Bassam
        Kurdali, director of Elephants Dream, states that the story is a parable
        of human relationships, and that it hints at how it is better to share
        ideas than force them on others.
